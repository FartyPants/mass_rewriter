# mass_rewriter
Extension for WEbUI

This is probably a little too complicated - but I build this to generate datasets, and use it all the time.
For now you would need to figure it out, or wait for some sort of description....

In anyway just to get a start - the text needs to be formatted with the \n\n\n between blocks of text (or whatever else you set in Block split) as it process it in block by block. and needs to reside in the input subfolder
To add blocks to a normal text, you can use the Blockify tab - it will create whatever.blockify.txt file in the input and se[arate blocks of text roughly by the number of characters specified. then you can use the .blockify.txt as your input.
