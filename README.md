# mass_rewriter
Extension for WEbUI

This is probably a little too complicated - but I build this to generate datasets using reverse learning, and I use it all the time. Sure, you can mess with it, but I can't guarantee you will figure it out.

In anyway just to get a start - the text needs to be formatted with the \n\n\n between blocks of text (or whatever else you set in Block split) as it process it in block by block. So maybe pargaraph by paragraph, etc... so each block should be about 800 or so. And the file needs to reside in the input subfolder. 


it uses LLM to format the text blocks to what you need - but you need to have smart model that does what you want it to do.
